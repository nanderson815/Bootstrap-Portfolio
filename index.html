                            life.
                            After

                            Magna Cum Laude with a dual major in Finance and International Business.</p>

                        <p>After graduation, Noah moved to Raleigh, North Carolina to work as an analyst for PNC Bank.

                            in the Treasury Management group within Corporate and Institutional Banking, where he
                            focused

                            from
                            Treasury Management to Capital Markets. Noah’s goal is to ensure the businesses he works
                            with
                            have

                            the tools and resources they need to succeed.</p>
